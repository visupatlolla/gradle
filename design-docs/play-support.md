This specification outlines the work that is required to use Gradle to build applications that use the [Play framework](http://www.playframework.com).

# Use cases

There are 3 main use cases:

- A developer builds a Play application.
- A developer runs a Play application during development.
- A deployer runs a Play application. That is, a Play application is packaged up as a distribution which can be run in a production environment.

# Out of scope

The following features are currently out of scope for this spec, but certainly make sense for later work:

- Building a Play application for multiple Scala versions. For now, the build for a given Play application will target a single Scala version.
  It will be possible to declare which version of Scala to build for.
- Using continuous mode with JVMs older than Java 7. For now, this will work only with Java 7 and later will be supported. It will be possible to build and run for Java 6.
- Any specific IDE integration, beyond Gradle's current general purpose IDE integration for Java and Scala.
- Any specific testing support, beyond Gradle's current support for testing Java and Scala projects.
- Any specific support for publishing and resolving Play applications, beyond Gradle's current general purpose capabilities.
- Any specific support for authoring plugins, beyond Gradle's current support.
- Installing the Play tools on the build machine.
- Migrating or importing SBT settings for a Play project.

# Performance

Performance should be comparable to SBT:

- Building and starting an application.
- Reload after a change.
- Executing tests for an application.

# Milestone 1

For the first milestone, a developer will be able to define, build and run a simple play application that consists
of routes and templates, Java and Scala sources, as well as Javascript, CSS, CoffeeScript and LESSCSS sources.

In this milestone we are not dealing with:
- Automatically rebuilding the play application when sources change
- 3rd party dependencies for Java, Scala or Javascript. (This may change).

The goal is to get something working pretty quickly, and work to improve the configurability and discoverability over time.

## Feature: Developer builds and runs a trivial Play application with templates and routes

### Story: Build author declares a Play application

Add a `play-application` plugin that provides Play application component:

    plugins {
        id 'play-application'
    }

    jvm {
        playApplications {
            helloworld {
            }
        }
    }

- Running `gradle assemble` builds an executable Jar.
- Each Play application produces a single binary.
- Running `gradle components` shows some basic details about the Play application.
- In this story, no source files are supported.

### Story: Developer includes template sources in Play application

Extend the Play support so that template source files for a Play application are compiled to byte code.

- Running `gradle assemble` generates Scala and Java source files from the templates source files and compiles these to byte code.
- The byte code is included in the executable Jar.
- Uses hard-coded Play and Scala versions.
- Templates source files are assumed to be in a hard-coded location. This won't be configurable for this story.
- No dependencies other than Scala and Play.
- Source generation and compilation should be incremental and remove stale outputs.

### Story: Developer defines routes for Play application

Extend the Play support so that routes for a Play application are compiled to byte code.

- Running `gradle assemble` generates Scala and Java source files from the routes source file and compiles these to byte code.
- The byte code is included in the executable Jar.
- Routes source files are assumed to be in a hard-coded location. This won't be configurable for this story.
- Source generation and compilation should be incremental and remove stale outputs.

### Story: Developer runs Play application

Extend the Play support to allow the Play application to be executed.

- Running `gradle assemble` produces an executable Jar that, when executed, runs the Play application.
- Running `gradle run<ComponentName>` builds and executes the Play application.

At this stage, only templates and routes are included, with a hard-coded version of Scala and Play.

## Feature: Developer builds a Play application from Java and Scala sources

### Story: Developer implements a Play application using Java

Extend the Play support to compile Java source for a Play application.

- Java source files are assumed to be in a hard-coded location. This won't be configurable for this story.
- No dependencies other than Scala and Play.

### Story: Developer implements a Play application using Scala

Extend the Play support to compile Scala source for a Play application.

- Scala source files are assumed to be in a hard-coded location. This won't be configurable for this story.
- No dependencies other than Scala and Play.
- No joint compilation.
Play support will be built using the new software component model, and we will extend and improve this model as we go. 

#### Test cases

- Test against multiple versions of Scala.

#### Open issues

- Replace `ScalaRuntime` with Scala platform and some kind of toolchain.

### Story: Build author declares target Play platform

- Provide a DSL to declare the target Play platform for a Play application.
- Implies Scala version and Java version?
- Should also be able to attach to a JVM library, to create a Play library.
- Play version should be visible in components report and dependencies reports.

#### Test cases

- Test against multiple versions of Play. Should include version 2.2.3

## Feature: Developer compiles assets for Play application

Extend the standard build lifecycle to compile the front end assets to CSS and Javascript.

- Compiled assets
    - Coffeescript -> Javascript
    - LESSCSS -> CSS
    - Javascript > Javascript via Google Closure
    - Javascript minification, requirejs optimization
- Include the compiled assets in the Jar
- Include the `public/` assets in the Jar
- Include Play config files in the Jar (e.g. `conf/play.plugins`)
- Define source sets for each type of source file
- Compilation should be incremental and remove stale outputs
- Expose some compiler options

### Implementation

JavaScript language plugin:

- Defines JavaScript library component and associated JavaScript bundle binary.
- Defines JavaScript source set type (a JavaScript bundle and JavaScript source set should be usable in either role).
- Defines transformation from JavaScript source set to JavaScript bundle.

CSS language plugin:

- Defines CSS library component and associated CSS bundle binary.
- Defines CSS source set type (a CSS bundle and CSS source set should be usable in either role).
- Defines transformation from CSS source set to CSS bundle.

CoffeeScript plugin:

- Defines CoffeeScript source set type and transformation to JavaScript bundle.

LESSCSS plugin:

- Defines LESSCSS source set type and transformation to CSS bundle.

Google Closure plugin:

- Defines transformation from JavaScript source set to JavaScript bundle.

Play plugin:

- Defines JavaScript and CSS components for the Play application.
- Wires in the appropriate outputs to assemble the Jar.

### Open issues

- Integration with existing Gradle javascript plugins.

## Feature: Developer builds and runs Play application

Introduce some lifecycle tasks to allow the developer to run or start the Play application. For example, the
developer may run `gradle run` to run the application or `gradle start` to start the application.

- Add basic server + service domain model and some lifecycle tasks
- Model Play application as service
- Lifecycle to run in foreground, or start in background, as per `play run` and `play start`

Note that this story does not address reloading the application when source files change. This is addressed by a later story.

### Implementation

Web application plugin:

- Defines the concept of a web application.
- Defines the concept of a server that can host a web application.
- Defines lifecycle tasks for a given deployment.

Play plugin:

- Defines a Play application as-a web application
- Provides a Play server implementation that can host a Play application.

## Feature: Developer builds Play application distribution

Introduce some lifecycle tasks to allow the developer to package up the Play application. For example, the
developer may run `gradle stage` to stage the local application, or `gradle dist` to create a standalone distribution.

- Build distribution image and zips, as per `play stage` and `play dist`
- Integrate with the distribution plugin.

### Implementation

Play plugin:

- Defines a distribution that bundles a Play server and Play application.

## Further features

- Model routes and templates as languages.
- Source sets for input languages for a Play application.
- Register Scala as a language, and change Play support to allow a Play application to take any language as input.
- Declare dependencies on other Java/Scala libraries
- Joint compilation of Java and Scala source.
- Can build multiple variants of a Play application.
- Generate an application install, eg with launcher scripts and so on.
- Build author runs unit and functional tests for a Play application.

# Milestone 2

## Feature: Long running compiler daemon

Reuse the compiler daemon across builds to keep the Scala compiler warmed up. This is also useful for the other compilers.

### Implementation

- Maintain a registry of compiler daemons in ~/.gradle
- Daemons expire some time after build, with much shorter expiry than the build daemon.
- Reuse infrastructure from build daemon.

## Feature: Keep running Play application up-to-date when source changes

This story adds an equivalent of Play's continuous mode (i.e. developer adds ~ before a command such as play ~run), where Gradle
monitors the source files for changes and rebuilds and restarts the application when some change is detected. Note that 'restart'
here means a logical restart.

Add a general-purpose mechanism which is able to keep the output of some tasks up-to-date when source files change. For example,
a developer may run `gradle --watch <tasks>`.

- Gradle runs tasks, then watches files that are inputs to a task but not outputs of some other task. When a file changes, repeat.
- Monitor files that are inputs to the model for changes too.
- When the tasks start a service, stop and restart the service(s) after rebuilding, or reload if supported by the service container.
- The Play application container must support reload. According to the Play docs the plugin can simply recreate the application
  ClassLoader.
- Integrate with the build-announcements plugin, so that desktop notifications can be fired when something fails when rerunning the tasks.

So:

- `gradle --watch run` would build and run the Play application. When a change to the source files are detected, Gradle would rebuild and
  restart the application.
- `gradle --watch test run` would build and run the tests and then the Play application. When a change to the source files is detected,
  Gradle would rerun the tests, rebuild and restart the Play application.
- `gradle --watch test` would build and run the tests. When a source file changes, Gradle would rerun the tests.

Note that for this story, the implementation will assume that any source file affects the output of every task listed on the command-line.
For example, running `gradle --watch test run` would restart the application if a test source file changes.

### Implementation

- Uses Gradle daemon to run build.
- Collect up all input files as build runs.
- Monitor changes to these input files. On change:
    - If previous build started any service, stop that service.
    - Trigger build.
- Deprecate reload properties from Jetty tasks, as they don't work well and are replaced by this general mechanism.

## Feature: Developer triggers rebuild of running Play application

This story adds an equivalent of Play's run command, where a build is triggered by the developer reloading the application in the browser
and some source files have changed.

The plugin will need to depend on Play's [sbt-link](http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/releases/com/typesafe/play/sbt-link/) library.
See [Play's BuildLink.java](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/master/framework/src/build-link/src/main/java/play/core/BuildLink.java)
for good documentation about interfacing between Play and the build system. Gradle must implement the BuildLink interface and provide
it to Play's NettyServer. When a new request comes in, Play will call Gradle's implementation of BuildLink.reload and if any files have
changed then Gradle will have to recompile and return a new classloader to Play.

## Feature: Resources are built on demand when running Play application

When running a Play application, start the application without building any resources. Build these resources only when requested
by the client.

- On each request, check whether the task which produces the requested resource has been executed or not. If not, run the task synchronously
  and block until completed.
- Include the transitive input of these tasks as inputs to the watch mechanism, so that further changes in these source files will
  trigger a restart of the application at the appropriate time.
- Failures need to be forwarded to the application for display.

## Feature: Developer views compile and other build failures in Play application

Adapt compiler output to the format expected by Play:

- Model configuration problems
- Java and scala compilation failures
- Asset compilation failures
- Other verification task failures?

# Milestone 3

## Documentation

- Migrating an SBT based Play project to Gradle
- Writing Gradle plugins that extend the base Play plugin

## Native integration with Specs 2

Introduce a test integration which allows Specs 2 specifications to be executed directly by Gradle, without requiring the use of the Specs 2
JUnit integration.

- Add a Specs 2 plugin
- Add some Specs 2 options to test tasks
- Detect specs 2 specifications and schedule for execution
- Execute specs 2 specifications using its API and adapt execution events

Note: no changes to the HTML or XML test reports will be made.

## Developer runs Scala interactive console

Allow the Scala interactive console to be launched from the command-line.

- Build the project's main classes and make them visible via the console
- Add support for client-side execution of actions
- Model the Scala console as a client-side action
- Remove console decoration prior to starting the Scala console

## Scala code quality plugins

- Scalastyle
- SCCT

## Javascript plugins

- Compile Dust templates to javascript and include in the web application image

## Bootstrap a new Play project

Extend the build init plugin so that it can bootstrap a new Play project, producing the same output as `play new` except with a Gradle build instead of
an SBT build.

# Later milestones

## Publish Play application to a binary repository

Allow a Play application distribution to be published to a binary repository.

Some candidates for later work:

- Improve the HTML test report to render a tree of test executions, for better reporting of Specs 2 execution (and other test frameworks)
- Support the new Java and Scala language plugins
- Improve watch mode so that only those tasks affected be a given change are executed
